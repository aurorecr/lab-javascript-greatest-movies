// Iteration 1: All directors? - Get the array of all directors.
//We need to get the array of all directors. Since this is a warm up, we will give you a hint: you have to map through the array of movies and get all the directors into one array as a final result. Go ahead and create a function named getAllDirectors() that receives an array of movies as an argument and returns a new (mapped array)


function getAllDirectors(arrParameters) {
  let arrDirector = arrParameters.map(function(Movies))
  return movies.director
});
 return arrDirector



// Iteration 2: Steven Spielberg. The best?
// One of the most famous directors in cinema is Steven Spielberg, and he has some really awesome drama movies that are on our list, but we want to know how many of them are there.

// Go ahead and create a howManyMovies() function that receives an array as a parameter and filter  the array so we can have only the drama movies where Steven Spielberg is the director.

function howManyMovies(selectionMovie[0]){
  let bestSpil = movies.director.StevenSpielberg.filter(function(Spil))
return {}
});

return howManyMovies
